# Snack4All

Snack4All is a food application and this project is the VR environment for the restaurant and the food menu.

- This is my AR/VR final project, a WebXR experience to see where you want to reserve, or see what you want to order in a restaurant with a Virtual Reality environment.
- You'll need a compatibe VR headset for the full experience.
- You'll need a compatible Browser for mixed reality experiences; ex: Mozilla Firefox.
- If you do not have a VR headset you can just move around with your WASD keys or clicking and dragging with your mouse.

## Technogologies used:
